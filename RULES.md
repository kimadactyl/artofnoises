The Art Of Noises
=================

## Overview

The Art Of Noises is a game of abstract musical performance for 3-5 people. Players take the role of avant-garde performers, attempting to communicate various nouns, verbs and adjectives using a variety of toy instruments.

Each player takes it in turn to select a card and perform the word on it. The other players guess which word is being performed. At the end of the game, the person with the most points wins, and is declared the most avant-garde.

## Components

 * 5 decision dials
 * Deck of noise cards
 * Score board with spaces for cards numbered 1-5
 * Triangle, maracas, rain stick, tambourine, glockenspiel, claves... whatever you can find

## Game Sequence

### Setup
 1. Give each player one decision dial. 
 2. Draw a noise card – the person most like the drawn card goes first.
 3. Shuffle the noise cards, and deal out a card to each space on the score track board. 

### Each round
 1. The first player (performer) picks one sound on a noise card on the score track, selecting it on their dial and placing it face down. After the first round, the performer can pay one point to re-deal all five cards.
 2. Using either two untuned instruments (triangle, maracas) or one tuned instrument (glockenspiel), the performer plays instruments to represent that card. 
 3. Other players guess in secret, placing their dial face down when they have decided.
 4. When everyone has selected, all the dials are flipped face up. Scores can be gained three ways.
  i. The performer scores 1 point per correct guess, as long as at least half of the people guessing (1 person in a 3 player game, 2 people in a 4 or 5 player game) guessed correctly.
  ii. Each correct guesser scores a point.
  iii. If half or more of the people guessing (1 person in a 3 player game, 2 people in a 4 or 5 player game) pick something different to the performer, then the group selecting this number all score one point. Who is the performer to call them incorrect?
 5. Any card which is guessed gets replaced – draw a new card and place it on top.
 6. Play rotates clockwise – continue for as many rounds as you like!

### Notes
 * Using acting to enhance performance is strongly discouraged. Some cards are easy to do by gesture, and much harder to do by sounds alone. This is a game about testing your musical performance activities, not your skill at Charades!
 * That said, this game is very much a toolkit – make your own cards (children's flash cards are recommended), bring your own instruments, adapt it however you wish.
 * However, be careful with instruments you blow into like kazoos or recorders, nobody wants to contract Glandular Fever from a board game.
 * In a 5 player game it's possible to have more than one card score, if the performer and two others pick one card, and the remaining two people pick a different one together. In this case, the performer would score two and everyone else one point.
 * It's possible to play with as many or few people as you like. Two players can play as a non-scoring pastime. More than five players can pair off as duos, or groups.

### Scoring Examples

Annie decides she is going to try and perform “red”, which is in the “2” slot. She sets her dial to “2”, places it face down, and begins her performance.

_Example 1_. Brenda, Cal, Davina and Eric immediately recognise her stirring rendition of an old Soviet marching tune. All four select “2” on their dial. Annie scores four points, everyone else scores one. “2” is replaced with a new card.

_Example 2_. Brenda, Cal and Davina are confused if the marching tune is a Soviet one, or one they heard at a football match. “Football” is on card 3, so all select “3”. Eric selects “2”. As Brenda, Cal and Davina are in the majority, they are therefore correct because that's how music works. They all score one point, nobody else scores anything. Cards “2” and “3” are replaced.

_Example 3_. Something goes horribly wrong in the performance with unintentional semiotics flying around like a drunk marmoset. Brenda picks “2”, Cal “3”, Davina “4”, and Eric “5”. Brenda was the only correct guesser, and gets one point. Nobody else scores. Cards 2, 3, 4 and 5 are replaced.
