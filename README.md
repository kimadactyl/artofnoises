The Art Of Noises
===========

The Art Of Noises is a game of abstract musical performance for 3-5 people. Players take the role of avant garde performers, attempting to communicate various nouns, verbs and adjectives using a variety of toy instruments.

Each player takes it in turn to select a card and perform the word on it. The other players guess which word is being performed. At the end of the game, the person with the most points wins, and is declared the most avant garde.
